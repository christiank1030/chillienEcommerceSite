                ​Self made brand. I drew a series of designs and ideas 
                at a young age with a stoned mind. Through trial and 
                error, I’ve turned these designs into a brand. There’s 
                a limited amount of products available at the moment, 
                but in time with success I’ll be able to continue to 
                release new designs and merchandise. With that being 
                said, stay tuned on social media and if you want to 
                support make sure to check out the shop.
